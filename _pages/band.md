### Recordings

### Rehearsals
I want rehersals to be free for everyone. I have a home studio that can support the band people easily. I currently don't have a drum kit but I am willing to invest in an electronic drum kit to make it work. With that being said if we need a rehersal space for a sepcific reason (recording, acoustic drum kit etc.) we might need to pay for that occasionally. However, I will make sure joining the band doesn't cost anything.

### What does the future hold for us?
I want to quickly get a live set going so we can start playing shows. We can focus on covers at first with 1-2 originals to quickly get the band going. After that we can start working on originals. You don't need to contribute to composing original songs but it's appreciated.
