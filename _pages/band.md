## The Band
This is a middle eastern / balkan music band with rock, psychedelic, funk, jazz, metal influences. I am picturing 3 - 5 people. We currently have two members (strings instruments and vocals). I am looking for a bass player (fretless would be preferred) and a drummer (bonus points if you can play percussion). The name of the band hasn't been decided yet, I do have ideas but I would prefer to pick something together. Ideally, we all contriubute to the band decisions (which songs to play, rehersal frequency, scheduling shows/rehersals etc.) but if you want less involvement that is ok.

### Inspirational Playlist

### Recordings
Katryn and I have made a few crude recordings which might give you some idea. You can imagine reinterpreting these with an instrument more similar to the songs in the playlist above.

### Rehearsals
I want rehersals to be free for everyone. I have a home studio that can support the band people easily. I currently don't have a drum kit but I am willing to invest in an electronic drum kit to make it work. With that being said if we need a rehersal space for a sepcific reason (recording, acoustic drum kit etc.) we might need to pay for that occasionally. However, I will make sure joining the band doesn't cost anything.

### Shows
I want to quickly get a live set going so we can start playing shows. We can focus on covers at first with 1-2 originals to quickly get the band going. After that we can start working on originals. You don't need to contribute to composing original songs but it's appreciated.

Kathryn and I played in many places around DC (Adams Morgan, Bossa, Green Zone, ...) and we can book shows in DC relatively easily. I am pretty new to Baltimore but I have a few contacts for shows.
