This once is pretty straightforward, just add a guitar pickup to a kalimba so you can just use a line output. I bought a single coil pickup with volume and tone knobs for ~10 bucks and after figuring out the layout started cutting. I wanted the pickup to be closer to the metal strips so I ended up making these little frames for both the pickup and the knobs and gave it a darker walnut finish. It sounds fine.
